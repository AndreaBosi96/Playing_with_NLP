# Playing_with_NLP
In this project I analyzed and cleaned a dataset with job ads. Then, I performed LDA to obtain labels and I developed various classifiers (also using BERT)
<br>
## Data
A dataset of about 9000 job ads was previously scraped from the web, with titles and descriptions for each entity.
## EDA
An extensive exploratory analysis was performed, in order to understand interesint patterns and features of the text data.
## Cleaning the dataset
It was mandatory to perform a deep transformation of the job ads, with typical text cleaning operations.
## LDA
The dataset was not labelled. To obtain some sort of classes, I devleoped a LDA model in order to divide the ads in 10 different topics (categories of job ads)
## Classifiers
I tried and trained different classifiers with different techniques. This also gave me the chance to finally try the BERT transformer.
